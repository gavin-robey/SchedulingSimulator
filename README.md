# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This is a simple Java program that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority, and Round Robin (RR).
Dependencies

     Java 8 or higher

## How to run

     Download or clone the repository.
     Navigate to the Driver folder in your terminal.
     Run the following command: java Assign5

## The program will run all the five scheduling algorithms one by one and display the number of context switches for each algorithm.
How to use

     Open the Assign5.java file in your favorite Java IDE.
     Modify the processes added in the demoXXX() methods to simulate different scenarios.
     Run the program as described above.

Note: The Platform class contains the core simulation logic, and the Scheduler classes implement the specific scheduling algorithms. You can modify these classes to customize the simulator to your needs.
